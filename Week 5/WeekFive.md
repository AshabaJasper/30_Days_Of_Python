## 💡 Beyond Day 30: Python Projects

Let's continue to challenge ourselves with new Python projects! Here are some suggestions:

### Day 31+: Blogging System

Create a blogging system where users can create an account, write blogs, read other users' blogs, and comment on them. Use a database to store user information and blog data.

### Day 35+: Chat Application

Build a chat application where users can send and receive messages in real time. Implement it as a web application using a framework like Flask or Django.

### Day 40+: Machine Learning Project

Dive into Machine Learning (ML) with Python by creating a simple ML project. You could predict house prices, classify images, detect spam emails, or anything else that interests you. Libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow will be very helpful.

### Day 45+: Web Scraper to API

Convert your web scraper from the final project into an API. This way, other developers can access the data your scraper collects via an API.

### Day 50+: Portfolio Website

Create a portfolio website to showcase all your projects. Use a Python web framework like Django or Flask, and deploy your website to a server.
