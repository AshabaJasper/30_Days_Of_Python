    "# Day 3: Python Variables and Assignment Statements 🌟🎉🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello, Pythonista! 🎉👨‍💻👩‍💻 Welcome to Day 3 of the 30 days of Python code challenge. Today, we will delve into Python variables and assignment statements. Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Variables 📚\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable in Python is like a container in the computer's memory where we can store a single value. If you want to use text in Python, you have to use a text string. A text string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes. You can use single or double quotes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Assigning a string to a variable\n",
    "message = \"Hello, Python!\"\n",
    "print(message)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can also assign a number (integer and float) to a variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Assigning an integer to a variable\n",
    "age = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Assigning a float to a variable\n",
    "pi = 3.14\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment Statements 📝\n",
    "\n",
    "An assignment statement creates a new variable and gives it a value. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Assignment statement\n",
    "number = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `number` is a variable, and `3` is the value assigned to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python also allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Assigning values to multiple variables\n",
    "a, b, c = 5, 3.2, \"Hello\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable Names and Keywords 💡\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable names in Python can be any length and can consist of uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), and the underscore character (_). They must start with a letter or the underscore character. They cannot start with a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Valid variable names\n",
    "my_var = 10\n",
    "_var = \"underscore var\"\n",
    "Var123 = \"Variable with digits\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also has a set of keywords that are reserved words that cannot be used as variable names. These keywords are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Python Keywords\n",
    "and, as, assert, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, else, except, False, finally, for, from, global, if, import, in, is, lambda, None, nonlocal, not, or, pass, raise, return, True, try, while, with, yield\n",
    "\n",
    "And here's your small exercise for the day!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 🏋️‍♀️🤓🎯🏁\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create three variables: one to store your name, one for your age, and one for your country. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then, use the print function to create a sentence about yourself like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I am [Your Name]. I am [Your Age] years old. I'm from [Your Country].\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Try to create a variable using one of the Python keywords and see the kind of error you get.\n",
    "\n",
    "Happy Coding! 🚀👩‍💻👨‍💻💻🌟\n"
