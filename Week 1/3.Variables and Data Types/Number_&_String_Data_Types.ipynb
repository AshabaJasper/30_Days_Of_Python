    "# Day 3 Continued: Python Number and String Data Types 🌟🎉🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "## Number Data Types in Python 🧮\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports three types of numbers - `int`, `float`, and `complex`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`int` stands for integer. It contains positive or negative whole numbers (without fraction or decimal).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Assigning an integer to a variable\n",
    "age = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "`float` stands for floating point number. It contains positive or negative decimal numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Assigning a float to a variable\n",
    "pi = 3.14\n",
    "\n",
    "`complex` numbers are represented in the form `x + yj`, where `x` and `y` are floats and `j` represents the square root of -1 (which is an imaginary number).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Assigning a complex number to a variable\n",
    "complex_number = 3+4j\n",
    "\n",
    "## String Data Type in Python 📝\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings in Python are identified as a contiguous set of characters represented in the quotation marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Assigning a string to a variable\n",
    "message = \"Hello, Python!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows for either pairs of single or double quotes. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create multi-line strings using triple quotes (single ''' or double \"\"\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Multi-line string\n",
    "about_me = '''\n",
    "Hello!\n",
    "I'm learning Python.\n",
    "I love it!\n",
    "'''\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type Conversion 🔄\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows you to convert data types. The process of converting the value of one data type (integer, string, float, etc.) to another data type is called type conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Converting integer to float\n",
    "float_age = float(20)\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Converting float to integer\n",
    "int_pi = int(3.14)\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Converting number to string\n",
    "str_age = str(20)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 🏋️‍♀️🤓🎯🏁\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assign your age to a variable as an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Assign your height to a variable as a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Assign your name to a variable as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Print your age, height, and name on separate lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Now, convert your age to a float and print it. Then, convert your height to an integer and print it. Try converting your name to an integer and see what happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Write a multi-line string about why you are learning Python and print it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Happy Coding! 🚀👩‍💻👨‍💻\n"
