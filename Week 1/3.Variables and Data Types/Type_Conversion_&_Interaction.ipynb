    "# Day 3 Conclusion: Type Conversion and Interaction 🌟🎉🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type Conversion in Python 🔄\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can convert one data type to another. We'll cover three primary types of conversion: `int`, `float`, and `str`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `int()`: This function converts a specified value into an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Converting float to int\n",
    "x = 3.14\n",
    "int_x = int(x)\n",
    "print(int_x)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `float()`: This function converts a specified value into a floating point number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Converting int to float\n",
    "y = 10\n",
    "float_y = float(y)\n",
    "print(float_y)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `str()`: This function converts a specified value into a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Converting int to string\n",
    "z = 20\n",
    "str_z = str(z)\n",
    "print(str_z)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: When converting from a float to an int, the number will be rounded down. When converting from a string to an int or float, the string needs to be numerical, or else you'll get an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interaction in Python 🤝\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key features of Python is its interactive prompt. You can use the `input()` function to prompt the user for input. This function reads a line from input, converts it into a string, and returns it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Prompting user for input\n",
    "name = input(\"What's your name? \")\n",
    "print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the `input()` function always returns a string. If you want a numerical value from the user, you'll need to convert that input using `int()` or `float()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Prompting user for numerical input\n",
    "age = int(input(\"How old are you? \"))\n",
    "print(\"You are \" + str(age) + \" years old!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 🏋️‍♀️🤓🎯🏁\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prompt the user for two numbers. Convert these numbers to integers and print their sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Prompt the user for their first and last name. Concatenate the names and print a message that says \"Hello, [first name] [last name]!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Try converting a non-numerical string into an integer and see what kind of error you get.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, errors are part of the learning process! Don't be afraid to make mistakes - they'll help you learn Python better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Happy Coding! 🚀👩‍💻👨‍💻💻🌟\n"
