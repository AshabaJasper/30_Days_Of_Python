    "### 👨‍💻 Programming Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages can be classified into several types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High-Level Languages** 😊: These are programmer-friendly languages that provide a high level of abstraction from the hardware. They are easy to learn and use. Examples include Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, C#, and Ruby.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Low-Level Languages** 🤖: These languages provide little or no abstraction from the hardware and are directly written for a specific hardware architecture. They are harder to learn and understand. Examples include Assembly language and Machine language.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Procedural Programming Languages** 📋: In procedural programming, a program is divided into one or more units or modules. Each module is a separate set of instructions that accomplishes a specific task. Examples include C, FORTRAN, and Pascal.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Languages** 🎭: OOP languages are based on the concept of \"objects\" which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. Examples include Python, Java, C++, and Ruby.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Functional Programming Languages** 🔄: Functional programming languages treat computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. Examples include Haskell, Lisp, and Scala.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Scripting Languages** 📜: Scripting languages are often interpreted rather than compiled. They are often used for automating tasks, and for developing certain types of applications like web or game scripting. Examples include Python, Perl, and JavaScript.\n",
