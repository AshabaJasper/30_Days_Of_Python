    "# Day 4: Python Operators 🌟🎉🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello, Pythonista! 🎉👨‍💻👩‍💻 Welcome to Day 4 of the 30 days of Python code challenge. Today, we're focusing on Python Operators. So let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Operators 💪\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. Python has several types of operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Arithmetic operators** are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Arithmetic operators\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "y = 3\n",
    "print(x + y)\n",
    "print(x - y)\n",
    "print(x * y)\n",
    "print(x / y)\n",
    "print(x % y)\n",
    "print(x ** y)\n",
    "print(x // y)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Comparison operators** are used to compare two values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Comparison operators\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "y = 3\n",
    "print(x == y)\n",
    "print(x != y)\n",
    "print(x > y)\n",
    "print(x < y)\n",
    "print(x >= y)\n",
    "print(x <= y)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Logical operators** are used to combine conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Logical operators\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "print(x > 5 and x < 15)\n",
    "print(x > 5 or x < 4)\n",
    "print(not(x > 5 and x < 15))\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Assignment operators** are used to assign values to variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Assignment operators\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "x += 3\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "x -= 3\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "x *= 3\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "x /= 3\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "x %= 3\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "x //= 3\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "x **= 3\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 🏋️‍♀️🤓🎯🏁\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assign a number to a variable. Use each arithmetic operator with this variable and a number of your choice, then print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Assign two different numbers to two different variables. Use each comparison operator with these variables, then print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use each logical operator with the comparison of these two variables and print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use each assignment operator with one of these variables and print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Happy Coding! 🚀👩‍💻👨‍💻💻🌟\n"
