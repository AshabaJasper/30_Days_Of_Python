    "# Day 5 Continued: While Loops in Python 🌟🎉🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello again, Pythonista! 🎉👨‍💻👩‍💻 We are still on Day 5 of the 30 days of Python code challenge. Now, let's dive into While Loops in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## While Loops in Python 🔄\n",
    "\n",
    "The `while` loop in Python is used to iterate over a block of code as long as the test expression (condition) is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The While Loop**: Here's a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Simple while loop\n",
    "counter = 0\n",
    "while counter < 5:\n",
    "    print(counter)\n",
    "    counter += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The break Statement**: The `break` statement in Python terminates the current loop and resumes execution at the next statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# While loop with break\n",
    "counter = 0\n",
    "while counter < 5:\n",
    "    print(counter)\n",
    "    if counter == 3:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    counter += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The continue Statement**: The `continue` statement in Python returns the control to the beginning of the loop. The `continue` statement rejects all the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop and moves the control back to the top of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# While loop with continue\n",
    "counter = 0\n",
    "while counter < 5:\n",
    "    counter += 1\n",
    "    if counter == 3:\n",
    "        continue\n",
    "    print(counter)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The else Statement with While Loop**: Python supports having an `else` statement associated with a loop statement. The `else` block just after `for/while` is executed only when the loop is NOT terminated by a `break` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# While loop with else\n",
    "counter = 0\n",
    "while counter < 5:\n",
    "    print(counter)\n",
    "    counter += 1\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"End of while loop\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. **Nested While Loops**: Python programming language allows the usage of one loop inside another loop. A loop inside another loop is called a nested loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Nested while loop\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "while i < 3:\n",
    "    j = 0\n",
    "    while j < 3:\n",
    "        print(i, j)\n",
    "        j += 1\n",
    "    i += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 🏋️‍♀️🤓🎯🏁\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 10 except 3 and 6 using a while loop and continue statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers using a while loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Write a Python program that uses a while loop to print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Write a Python program using a while loop that asks the user for a number, and prints a countdown from that number to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Happy Coding! 🚀👩‍💻👨‍💻💻🌟\n"
