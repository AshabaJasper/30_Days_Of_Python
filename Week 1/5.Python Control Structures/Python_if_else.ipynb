    "# Day 5 Continued: If-Else Statements in Python 🌟🎉🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello again, Pythonista! 🎉👨‍💻👩‍💻 We are still on Day 5 of the 30 days of Python code challenge. Now, let's dive into If-Else Statements in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## If-Else Statements in Python 🚦\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `if…elif…else` statement is used for decision making, i.e., it controls the flow of execution based on certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The if Statement**: Python's `if` statement allows you to examine the current state of a program and respond appropriately to that state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Simple if statement\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "if x > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is positive\")\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The else Statement**: Python's `else` statement complements the `if` statement. An `if/else` pair says: \"If this expression is true, run this indented block of code. Otherwise, run this code instead.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# if-else statement\n",
    "x = -5\n",
    "if x > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is positive\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is not positive\")\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The elif Statement**: The `elif` statement allows you to check multiple expressions for truth and execute a block of code as soon as one of the conditions is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# if-elif-else statement\n",
    "x = 0\n",
    "if x > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is positive\")\n",
    "elif x == 0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is zero\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is negative\")\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Nested if Statements**: There may be a situation when you want to check for another condition after a condition resolves to true. In such a situation, you can use the nested `if` construct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Nested if statement\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "if x > 0:\n",
    "    if x % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        print(\"x is a positive even number\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"x is a positive odd number\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is not positive\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 🏋️‍♀️🤓🎯🏁\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a Python program to check if a number is positive, negative or zero using if-elif-else statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write a Python program to find the largest among three numbers using nested if statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Write a Python program to check if a year is a leap year or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Happy Coding! 🚀👩‍💻👨‍💻💻🌟\n"
