    "# Day 5: For Loops in Python 🌟🎉🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello, Pythonista! 🎉👨‍💻👩‍💻 Welcome to Day 5 of the 30 days of Python code challenge! Today, we're diving into for loops in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## For Loops in Python 🔄\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, \"for\" loops are used for sequential traversal. It falls under the category of definite iteration, meaning that the number of times the loop is executed is defined in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **For loop with Lists**: \n",
    "\n",
    "For loop can iterate over the elements of a given list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Iterating through a list\n",
    "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
    "for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "    print(fruit)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **For loop with Strings**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to lists, for loop can iterate over the characters of a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Iterating through a string\n",
    "for letter in 'Pythonista':\n",
    "    print(letter)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **For loop with the range() function**: \n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in function `range()` is handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Iterating through a range\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **For loop with Dictionaries**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can use for loop to iterate over the keys of a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Iterating through a dictionary\n",
    "info = {'name': 'Python', 'version': '3.9.1'}\n",
    "for key in info:\n",
    "    print(key, info[key])\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Nested For loops**:\n",
    "\n",
    "A nested loop is a loop inside a loop. You can use one or more loop inside any `for` loop, `while` loop etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Nested for loop\n",
    "for i in range(3):\n",
    "    for j in range(3):\n",
    "        print(i, j)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **The break and continue Statements**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `break` statement stops the loop before it has looped through all the items, while the `continue` statement stops the current iteration and continues with the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Using break and continue\n",
    "for num in [20, 11, 9, 66, 4, 89, 44]:\n",
    "    if num%2 == 0:\n",
    "        continue\n",
    "    if num > 50:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    print(num)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 🏋️‍♀️🤓🎯🏁\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a list of your 5 favorite foods. Write a for loop that prints \"I love [food]\" for each food in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use the range() function to print the numbers from 0-9.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a nested loop that prints a pattern of asterisks that looks like a rectangle. The rectangle should be 5 asterisks tall and 5 asterisks wide.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create a list of numbers and print out all the odd numbers using the `continue` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Modify the above task to stop the loop if a number greater than 50 is encountered using the `break` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Happy Coding! 🚀👩‍💻👨‍💻💻🌟\n"
