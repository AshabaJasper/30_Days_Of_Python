    "# Day 6: File Reading and Writing in Python 🌟🎉🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello Pythonista! 🎉👨‍💻👩‍💻 Welcome to Day 6 of the 30 days of Python code challenge! Today, we're learning about reading and writing files in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## File Reading and Writing in Python 📖✍️\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides basic functions and methods necessary to manipulate files by default. You can do most of the file manipulation using a file object.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Opening a File**: Python has a built-in function `open()` to open a file. This function returns a file object, also called a handle, as it is used to read or modify the file accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Open a file\n",
    "file = open(\"testfile.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reading a File**: The `read()` function reads the entire file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Read the file\n",
    "print(file.read())\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Writing to a File**: The `write()` function writes any string to an open file. The file must be opened in write 'w', append 'a' or exclusive creation 'x' mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Open the file in write mode\n",
    "file = open(\"testfile.txt\", \"w\")\n",
    "file.write(\"Hello World!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Closing a File**: After you're done with a file, you can use the `close()` function to free up the resources that were tied with the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Close the file\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Using with Statement**: The best way to close a file is by using the `with` statement. This ensures that the file is closed when the block inside the `with` statement is exited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# Open and read a file\n",
    "with open(\"testfile.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    print(file.read())\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 🏋️‍♀️🤓🎯🏁\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a Python program to read an entire text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write a Python program to append text to a file and display the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Write a Python program to read a file line by line and store it into a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Write a Python program to read a file line by line and store it into a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Write a Python program to write a list to a file.\n",
    "\n",
